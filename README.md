# multithreaded-sudoku-validator
In order to determine the validity of the sudoku solution, 27 threads are created, 9 for each 3x3 subsection, 9 for each row, and 9 for each column. The sudoku solution is defined in the programs and can be updated. The program simply outputs whether or not the solution is a valid one.
